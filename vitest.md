# Vitest Support in Early AI Extension

The Early AI extension supports multiple testing frameworks for generating unit tests, including **Vitest**, **Jest** (default), and **Mocha**. This guide explains how to configure the extension to generate unit tests in **Vitest** format for JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

---

## Default Testing Framework

By default, the extension generates unit tests in **Jest** format. If you wish to use **Vitest** as your testing framework, you can change this setting in the extension's proprietary settings screen.

---

## Switching to Vitest

To enable **Vitest** as your testing framework:

1. Open the **Settings** screen in the extension.

            alt="Settings Screen in the Extension" width=400 >
   </figure>
   <br>

2. Locate the **Testing Framework** section.  
   ![Testing framework Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earlyai/earlyai-docs/main/media/settings/settings.jpg "Settings Screen in the Extension")

3. In the dropdown menu, select **Vitest**.

4. Once selected, the settings will save automatically. All future tests generated by the extension will now align with the **Vitest** framework.

## Generating Tests with Vitest

After switching to **Vitest**, the process for generating tests remains the same:

1. Use the extension to locate the function or method you wish to test.  
2. Initiate test generation using the "Generate Tests" button.  
3. The generated tests will now use **Vitest** syntax and conventions.

## Additional Notes

- The **Testing Framework** dropdown also includes **Mocha** as an option if you wish to switch frameworks in the future.
- You can change the testing framework at any time through the **Settings** screen.
